## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Language Detection Model** using various **Indian languages including English**. The model will classify text into different languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, and more.

## Key Features
- **Multi-language support** (focus on Indian languages)
- **Deep Learning** based classification
- **Dataset**: Created by using indic-nlp-library.
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and padding.
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Networks

## Goals
- Accurate classification of Indian languages from text input.
- Handle noise and mixed-language input scenarios.
- Deploy as a lightweight application.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tkinter (for GUI)
